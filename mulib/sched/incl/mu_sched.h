Implmeentation notes:

mu_sched implements a discrete time, run-to-completion scheduler.  A mu_task can
be scheduled to run at some point in the future through the following calls:

    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_task_now(mu_task_t *task);
    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_task_at(mu_task_t *task, mu_time_t at);
    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_task_in(mu_task_t *task, mu_duration_t in);
    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_reschedule_now(void);
    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_reschedule_in(mu_duration_t in);

Each of these functions add a task to the scheduler's queue, implemented as a
doubly linked list.  In every case, if the task is already present in the queue,
it is removed prior to scheduling.  This prevents "runaway" scheduling.

The following functions support scheduling events from interrupt level:

    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_isr_task_now(mu_task_t *task);
    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_isr_task_at(mu_task_t *task, mu_time_t at);
    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_isr_task_in(mu_task_t *task, mu_duration_t in);

The function

    mu_sched_err_t mu_sched_step(void);

is where all the magic happens.  The scheduler examines the first task in the
queue, and if its start time has arrived, the task is removed from the queue and
is called.

## Implementation of the scheduler queue

mu_sched makes an conscious design choice that each task may only appear once
in the schedule.  This means that at each call to mu_sched_task_xxx(task), the
scheduler must check to see if the task is already in the queue, and if so, to
remove it.

To support fast check and removal of a task, the scheduler queue is implemented
as a doubly linked list: removing a task from the queue merely requires a pair
of pointer operations.

This approach also means that the task can encapsulate the `prev` and `next`
link fields requires to insert it into the queue, so no additional storage is
required.

## Implementation of the ISR queue

mu_sched supports scheduling tasks from interrupt level via the
`mu_sched_isr_task_xxx()` functions.  Unlike their foreground counterparts,
these functions do not add tasks directly to the scheduler queue.  Instead,
tasks are added to a "single produce, single consumer" isr queue, which is
guaranteed to be interrupt safe.

At foreground level, at the next call to mu_sched_step(), any tasks on the isr
queue are transferred from the isr queue to the regular scheduler queue.
